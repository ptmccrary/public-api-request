# Awesome Startup Employee Directory

Makes use of random user Generator API ('https://randomuser.me/') to create an employee directory for a fictional startup company. This app is a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

This app requests a JSON object from the API and parses the data so 12 'employees' are listed.

## Usage

- 12 employees will be listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location are listed.

- Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

- Clicking on the next/prev buttons within the modal windows will cycle through the employees respectively.

- Any specific user can be displayed on the page with the use of the search bar.
